### ColdWallet for Windows

[ColdWallet.win](https://github.com/coinexchain/ColdWallet.win) is a cold wallet for CoinEx Chain, running on windows. It is an one-file executable and you can copy and use it without installation.

Although it's OK to use this cold wallet on the Windows operating system for your everyday work, we suggest you to use it only on Windows PE which is installed on a USB stick, instead of the hard disk.

Windows PE is special OS mainly used for system management. Usually we install it on a USB stick and make the computer boot from the USB stick. It runs totally on the USB stick and does not relay on the data in hard disk.

A USB stick with Windows PE installed is very useful for installing new OS or recovering data. Here, we just use it as an isolated clean environment to run ColdWallet.win. Since the data on hard disk can not affect it, it is free from the viruses and spywares on hard disk.

Just install windows PE to your USB stick and copy ColdWallet.win onto it, you can turn this USB stick to **a low-cost secure cold wallet**. When you want to use this cold wallet, you just plug it into a notebook and boot from it. The windows PE on it will run start a clean, virus-free environment for ColdWallet.win to run, no matter what OS and programs are installed on the hard disk.

ColdWallet.win works without internet connection. So when windows PE is started, do not plug a network cable to the notebook and do not enter your WIFI password, just leave it off-line. ColdWallet.win uses QRCode to communicate with a hot wallet. It uses the webcam of notebook to read QRCode for inputs and shows its outputs with on-screen QRCode.

Because the notebook is offline, there's no information can leak from it except the data shown in QRCode, which is well controlled. This is why a cold wallet is more secure than a hot wallet. If you have a lot of assets on CoinEx Chain, you surely need a secure cold wallet.
